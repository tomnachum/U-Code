# basic-dom

A mini-project in vanilla js, in which we built a simple game.

![Alt text](/images/game.png?raw=true "Optional Title")

In this game, the user can use the arrow keys to move the ball inside the red box, or to use the arrow symbols on the screen.

In case the user tries to move the ball outside of the red box, the ball will not move, and will always stay inside the red box.
